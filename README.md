### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**Welcome to my profile!** :star_struck: <br> The green dots on my [**GitHub** profile](https://github.com/abhinayTiwari?tab=repositories) represent my journey :running_man: - From **being curious** with *computers* to *software* and Now I'm focusing to develop MERN based applications and fall in love with JavaScript along with interesting animation, beautiful UI,.. so I decided to spend a lot of time on learning React, React Native and Typescript.
